This is the implementation of CRC algorithm and I provide a simple example file named "file" to test it.

HOW TO DO
First of all, make files generator.c verifier.c alter.c on Linux.
And then, 
if you want to get the original text not modified, type:
        "./generator <file | ./verifier"
if you want to alter one bit of the message transmitted, type:
        "c./generator <file | ./alter 1 | ./verifier".
Of course, you can use your own test file instead.^_^
